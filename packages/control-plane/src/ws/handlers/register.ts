/**
 * `register` → `register/ok` handler (design §4.6, protocol §3.3).
 *
 * The convergence point: records capabilities (C4), then asks the C3 reconcile
 * service for the authoritative snapshot built from the C6 routing table. The
 * connection advances to READY (the only state in which the CP issues control),
 * the owned sessions are bound in the `ConnectionRegistry`, and the `register/ok`
 * REP (`corr` = the `register` frame id) is sent.
 *
 * Idempotent: re-sending `register` re-runs reconcile and yields the same
 * snapshot (CP wins all conflicts) — reconnect is convergence, not replay.
