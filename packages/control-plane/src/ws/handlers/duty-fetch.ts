/**
 * Teach this connection which org the fetched resources belong to.
 *
 * The id→org maps are otherwise built ONLY from the `register` reconcile
 * snapshot, so a resource a member acquires mid-session through `duty/fetch` is
 * absent from them until its next reconnect. Any later C→D frame whose payload
 * carries a bare id — a session/workspace/memory read keyed on `agentId`,
 * `cron/run`, `integration/forget` — then has no org to resolve on an
 * install-wide connection and raises SCOPE_DENIED before it is sent.
 *
 * This is a scoping HINT, never an authorization: holding the duty is what
 * authorizes, and a frame for a resource the member declined to install still
 * fails on the member. Recording it optimistically is therefore safe, and it
 * also lets the inbound gate cross-check the org the member claims.
 *
 * The removal frames do NOT rely on this — they carry an explicit org, which is
 * authoritative and local to the send. This only covers the frames that cannot.
