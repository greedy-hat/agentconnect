/**
 * `AgentDelivery` — the ONE answer to "which daemons must receive this agent's
 * updates", and the fan-out that rides it.
 *
 * Placement used to be that answer, read inline as `agent.daemonId` at every
 * replicate site. A duty grant broke it: a pool member that wins a duty for an
 * agent it is not the placement of installs one bundle (`duty/fetch`) and then
 * serves it frozen, because every spec edit, rotated credential and organization
 * secret rides a placement-keyed push. The delivery set is therefore the union —
 * the placement if the agent has one, plus every member currently holding an
 * unexpired duty lease covering it.
 *
 * It is a seam, not a special case, and that is now load-bearing: placement is a TARGET rather
 * than a member id, so a `pool` agent names no machine at all and the ledger is its entire
 * delivery set. `PlacementResolver` owns that translation; this file never reads a placement kind.
 * The lifecycle sends keep taking an explicit `orgId`, because an install-wide
 * (frame-mode) member's connection carries no org and a duty holder is exactly
 * the connection that cannot resolve one from its own maps.
