 * Feature flags, as the console sees them.
 *
 * `FEATURE_FLAGS` is a comma-separated list of the ids below, read at runtime through
 * `window.__AC_ENV` — so one prebuilt image serves every environment and a deployment decides
 * which flagged surfaces it shows. Unset means none: a new flag cannot arrive on.
 *
 * This is a CONSOLE-side switch. The Control Plane serves the feature either way; what an
 * environment turns off here is whether the console offers it, not whether it exists. That is the
 * point — the feature stays exercised end to end wherever it is on, with no server-side variant to
 * reason about.
 *
 * A flag is either temporary — an experiment, deleted once its feature is on everywhere — or a
 * standing switch for a surface only some deployments ever offer. Retiring one is removing its id
 * here and the checks with it.
