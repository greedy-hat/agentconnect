/**
 * Native Discord application (slash) command definitions, registered globally on
 * connect (see DiscordConnection.start → registerCommands). They make the same
 * control vocabulary the daemon already parses from plain `/text` messages
 * (see commands.ts) show up in Discord's `/` autocomplete menu with descriptions
 * and typed arguments.
 *
 * These are NOT a second command engine: a slash invocation is reconstructed back
 * into its `/text` form (DiscordConnection.slashCommandText) and fed through the
 * SAME onInbound → parseCommand → handleCommand path as a typed message, so the
 * names/args here MUST stay in lockstep with parseCommand's vocabulary (guarded by
 * discord-app-commands.test.ts).
 *
 * PREREQUISITE: the bot must be invited with the `applications.commands` OAuth2
 * scope, else `commands.set` fails with 403 Missing Access and nothing appears.
 *
 * The select commands (`/models` `/effort` `/permission`) take an OPTIONAL free-text
 * argument — omitting it lists the choices as a tappable button card (buildDiscord-
 * SelectComponents); passing it selects directly. Choices aren't pre-declared because
 * the offered options are model-dependent and only known once a session is warm.
