 * a stale row that merely contains the quote can invert it ("do not deploy now" versus
 * "deploy now"). Deliberately nothing cleverer, because the daemon records no fact that
 * implies the current ACP session has seen this message, and each available proxy is
 * weaker than it looks:
 *
 * - Cursor order: `ts` is text, so Telegram's ascending ids can miscompare.
 * - A delivery receipt is written before prompt and can survive a later ready-gate cancel.
 * - Own authorship only proves that some past session produced the quoted message.
